
HOW TO BUNDLE UP SUPERCOLLIDER FOR WINDOWS (PSYCOLLIDER)

Building the Psycollider-based Windows build is currently done with Visual Studio -
see the README WINDOWS file for more about that.

The installer is then created using Microsoft's "WiX" (Windows Installer XML) system, 
automated using a python script (needed to add all the classfiles, helpfiles etc into
the installer XML). The python script also ensures SwingOSC is included, converts 
the Psycollider.py into an EXE, and bundles everything into a zip file.


REQUIREMENTS:

 - WiX toolset v3 or later, installed and in your path 
           (so that the python script can call "candle" and "light" on the commandline)
 - python
 - wxPython (I used wx-2.8-msw-unicode)
 - py2exe - see http://www.py2exe.org
 - SwingOSC. Please put SwingOSC's help folder into the main SC Help folder,
	SwingOSC's classes folder into the main SCClassLibrary folder, and
	SwingOSC.jar into the main SuperCollider build folder.
 - DLLs for FFTW and libsndfile. Put these into the build folder.


METHOD:

On the commandline do this:

	cd SuperCollider/windows
	python distrowin.py

Watch the commandline output for anything going wrong...

(There will be a lot of output, including many LGHT1076 warnings about microsoft's 
own bundle using too-long string names [sigh])

If all goes well, you will have a file "supercollider-installer.zip" which is the file to distribute.

The most likely problem I expect is that paths might be slightly different, because some 
paths have version numbers in them.
